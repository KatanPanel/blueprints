# blueprints
"Blueprint" are what we call entities that holds the definitions of properties used in units created by Katan.

Configuration files are the information based on the composition of applications in unit creation environment.

Each file contains properties that can be used to customize the final output of the unit build, through it you can assign properties, change build format and configuration, among other things, units have their own default build settings but it always prioritizes the application target assigned to it. Blueprints files uses the [HOCON](https://github.com/lightbend/config/blob/main/HOCON.md) file format.
